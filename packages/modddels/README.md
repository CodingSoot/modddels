**Introducing MODDDELS:** A powerful code generator that allows you to create self-validated models with compile-safe states, seamless failure handling, and easy unit-testing.

# Motivation

Let's say you want to model a `Student` object. The `Student` has a name, an age, and an email. You may create your class/data-class this way :

```dart
class Student {
  Student({
    required this.name,
    required this.age,
    required this.email,
  });

  final String name;
  final int age;
  final String email;
}
```

You will then need to validate the `name`, `age` and `email` in various parts of your app. The `Student` model will be used in different places : for example, a widget that displays a student profile, or a function `addStudent(Student newStudent)`, etc...

**There are several problems with this approach :**

- Where should you validate the `name`, `age` and `email` ?
- After validation is done, how can you distinguish between a valid `Student` instance and an invalid one ?
- How can you ensure that valid `Student` instances are passed to functions or widgets that require them, and likewise, invalid instances are passed to those that specifically handle them?
- How to handle an invalid `Student` differently based on what field is invalid and why it's invalid, all this in various parts of the app ?
- If you have, for example, a widget that displays the `email` of a `Student`. How can you prevent any random string from being passed to the widget ?

**All these problems (and more) can be resolved by using this package.**

The **_Modddels_** package offers a way to validate your models and deal with its different states (valid, invalid...) in a _type-safe_ and _compile-safe_ way.

- ðŸ”Ž **Self-Validation :** Your models are validated upon creation. This way, you'll never deal with non-validated models.
- ðŸ§Š **Sealed class :** Your model is a sealed class, which union cases are the different states it can be (valid, invalid...). _For example, `Student` would be a sealed class with union-cases `ValidStudent` and `InvalidStudent`._
- ðŸš¨ **Failures handling :** Your model, when invalid, holds the responsible failure(s), which you can access anytime anywhere.
- ðŸ”’ **Value Equality and Immutability :** All models are immutable and override `operator ==` and `hashCode` for data equality.
- ðŸ§ª **Unit-testing :** Easily test your models and the validation logic.

> **NB :** This package is NOT a data-class generator. It is meant to create models that are at the core of your app _(If you use DDD or Clean architecture, those would be in the "domain" layer)_. Therefore, you are meant to create separate classes for things like json serialization, either manually or with tools like [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) and [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) _(These classes are usually called "DataTransferObjects", "DTOs", or simply "models")_.

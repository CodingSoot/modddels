**Introducing MODDDELS:** A powerful code generator that allows you to create self-validated models with compile-safe states, seamless failure handling, and easy unit-testing.

# Motivation

Let's say you want to model a `Student` object. The `Student` has a name, an age, and an email. You may create your class/data-class this way :

```dart
class Student {
  Student({
    required this.name,
    required this.age,
    required this.email,
  });

  final String name;
  final int age;
  final String email;
}
```

You will then need to validate the `name`, `age` and `email` in various parts of your app. The `Student` model will be used in different places : for example, a widget that displays a student profile, or a function `addStudent(Student newStudent)`, etc...

**There are several problems with this approach :**

- Where should you validate the `name`, `age` and `email` ?
- After validation is done, how can you distinguish between a valid `Student` instance and an invalid one ?
- How can you ensure that valid `Student` instances are passed to functions or widgets that require them, and likewise, invalid instances are passed to those that specifically handle them?
- How to handle an invalid `Student` differently based on what field is invalid and why it's invalid, all this in various parts of the app ?
- If you have, for example, a widget that displays the `email` of a `Student`. How can you prevent any random string from being passed to the widget ?

**All these problems (and more) can be resolved by using this package.**

The **_Modddels_** package offers a way to validate your models and deal with its different states (valid, invalid...) in a _type-safe_ and _compile-safe_ way.

- ðŸ”Ž **Self-Validation :** Your models are validated upon creation. This way, you'll never deal with non-validated models.
- ðŸ§Š **Sealed class :** Your model is a sealed class (compatible with previous versions of Dart) which has union-cases for the different states it can be in (valid, invalid...). _For example, `Student` would be a sealed class with union-cases `ValidStudent` and `InvalidStudent`._
- ðŸš¨ **Failures handling :** Your model, when invalid, holds the responsible failure(s), which you can access anytime anywhere.
- ðŸ”’ **Value Equality and Immutability :** All models are immutable and override `operator ==` and `hashCode` for data equality.
- ðŸ§ª **Unit-testing :** Easily test your models and the validation logic.

> **NB :** This package is NOT a data-class generator. It is meant to create models that are at the core of your app _(If you use DDD or Clean architecture, those would be in the "domain" layer)_. Therefore, you are meant to create separate classes for things like json serialization, either manually or with tools like [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) and [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) _(These classes are usually called "DataTransferObjects", "DTOs", or simply "models")_.

# Example

Here is a sneak peek at what you can do with **modddels**. You can find the full example in the [`example` folder](https://github.com/CodingSoot/modddels/tree/master/packages/modddels/example).

```dart
// In this example, [Username], [Age] and [User] are all "modddels".
void main() {
  final username =
      Username('dash_the_bird', availabilityService: MyAvailabilityService());

  final age = Age(20);

  final user = User.appUser(username: username, age: age);

  // Map over the different validation states of the user.
  user.map(
    valid: (valid) => greetUser(valid),
    invalidMid: (invalidMid) => redirectToProfileInfoScreen(invalidMid),
  );
}

// This method can only accept a [ValidUser], i.e a valid instance of [User].
void greetUser(ValidUser user) {
  final username = user.username.value;

  // Map over the different types of users ([AppUser] or [Moderator])
  final greeting = user.mapUser(
      appUser: (validAppUser) => 'Hey $username ! Enjoy our app.',
      moderator: (validModerator) =>
          'Hello $username ! Thanks for being a great moderator.');

  print(greeting);
}

// This method can only accept an [InvalidUserMid], i.e an invalid instance of
// [User] specifically because of a failure in the validationStep named "mid".
void redirectToProfileInfoScreen(InvalidUserMid user) {
  print('Redirecting to profile ...');

  // Checking if the `age` is invalid, and handling the only possible failure.
  user.age.mapOrNull(
    invalidValue: (invalidAgeValue) => invalidAgeValue.legalFailure.map(
      minor: (_) => print('You should be 18 to use our app.'),
    ),
  );

  // Checking if the `username` is invalid, and handling its possible failures.
  user.username.map(
    valid: (validUsername) {},
    invalidValue1: (invalidUsernameValue1) {
      // Handling failures of the "length" validation.
      if (invalidUsernameValue1.hasLengthFailure) {
        final errorMessage = invalidUsernameValue1.lengthFailure!.map(
          empty: (value) => 'Username can\'t be empty.',
          tooShort: (value) =>
              'Username must be at least ${value.minLength} characters long.',
          tooLong: (value) =>
              'Username must be less than ${value.maxLength} characters long.',
        );
        print(errorMessage);
      }

      // Handling failures of the "characters" validation.
      if (invalidUsernameValue1.hasCharactersFailure) {
        final errorMessage = invalidUsernameValue1.charactersFailure!.map(
          hasWhiteSpace: (hasWhiteSpace) =>
              'Username can\'t contain any whitespace character.',
          hasSpecialCharacters: (hasSpecialCharacters) =>
              'Username can only contain letters, numbers and dashes.',
        );
        print(errorMessage);
      }
    },
    invalidValue2: (invalidUsernameValue2) {
      // Handling failures of the "availability" validation. This validation is
      // part of a separate validationStep than the two previous ones for
      // optimization purposes.
      final errorMessage = invalidUsernameValue2.availabilityFailure.map(
        unavailable: (unavailable) => 'Username is already taken.',
      );

      print(errorMessage);
    },
  );
}
```
